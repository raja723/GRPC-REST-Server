# GRPC-REST microservice

The bc.proto defines the message types and their structure for my GRCP server and clients.

The two files bc_pb2.py and bc_grpc.py have been generated by the GRPCC/protoc compiler.

protoBuffClient.py is the GRCP server implementation. In this file I am implementing the service defined for GRCP. The main step is reading the CSV for usage metrics into the repeated type field of the message timeSeries, and then serializing every row read and returning back the serialized data as a buffer type to the caller.

protoBuffClient.py is the GRCP client implementation. It makes a call to the GRCP server to fetch the serialized data and converts it into JSON format.

flaskWebServer.py is a small flask application which is a http microserver framework in python. Over here, I made use of a feature of python that if you import a variable from another python module which is not directly called, the calling/running module runs that module automatically. Finally I return the JSON as part of the GET http request.

templates is just a folder with my static html. Flask needs a templates folder to render html files. It is a folder hierarchy required by it.
